Certainly! Here's your SQL code with detailed comments explaining each section:

```sql
-- Create a temporary table 'customerStatus' to store the count of rentals per customer
-- and their customer ID
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customerStatus 
SELECT 
    count(*) as NoOfRentals, customer_id
FROM
    rental
GROUP BY 
    customer_id;
    
-- Display the data in the 'customerStatus' temporary table
SELECT * FROM customerStatus;

-- Create a function named 'CustomerLevel' to determine the customer level based on the number of rentals
-- The function takes a DECIMAL parameter 'NoOfRentals' and returns a VARCHAR result
DELIMITER $$

CREATE FUNCTION CustomerLevel(
    NoOfRentals DECIMAL(10)
) 
RETURNS VARCHAR(20)
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
    -- Declare a variable 'customerLevel' to store the calculated customer level
    DECLARE customerLevel VARCHAR(20);

    -- Determine the customer level based on the number of rentals
    IF NoOfRentals > 30 THEN
        SET customerLevel = 'PLATINUM';
    ELSEIF (NoOfRentals >= 20 AND NoOfRentals <= 30) THEN
        SET customerLevel = 'GOLD';
    ELSEIF NoOfRentals < 20 THEN
        SET customerLevel = 'SILVER';
    END IF;
    
    -- Return the calculated customer level
    RETURN (customerLevel);
END$$
DELIMITER ;

-- Calculate customer levels based on the data in the 'customerStatus' temporary table
-- The result includes the customer ID and their calculated level
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    CustomerLevel(NoOfRentals)
FROM
    customerStatus;
    
-- Display the data in the 'rental' table
-- Columns: NoOfRentals, customer_id
SELECT * FROM rental;

-- End of SQL script
```

This code defines a temporary table, a function to determine customer levels, and performs queries to calculate and display customer levels based on the rental count. The comments provide explanations for each step in the process.
